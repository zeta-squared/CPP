This document contains all the non-coding exercises of Chapter 2 of C++ Primer.
\subsubsection*{Exercise 2.1}

The different integer types vary in their minimum bit sizes and so their minimum value range:
\begin{itemize}
	\item [\texttt{short}]
		16 bits gives a value range of -32768 -- 32767.
	\item [\texttt{int}]
		16 bits gives a value range of -32768 -- 32767.
	\item [\texttt{long}]
		32 bits gives a value range of -2147483648 -- 2147483647.
	\item [\texttt{long long}]
		64 bits vies a value range of -9223372036854775808 -- 9223372036854775807.
\end{itemize}

\texttt{unsigned} types do not include negative values, that is, values $\geq 0$, for example if we consider \texttt{unsigned int} the value range is 0 -- 65536. Of course a \texttt{signed} type takes negative values.

Lastly, both \texttt{float} and \texttt{double} represent decimal precision values. The difference is in the accuracy of precision, a \texttt{float} is precise to 6 significant digits and \texttt{double} is precise to 10 significant digits.

\subsubsection*{Exercise 2.2}
They should all be \texttt{double} as they all involved decimal figures.

\subsubsection*{Exercise 2.3}
Assuming the machine is 32 bits for integers the outputs are (in order):
\begin{itemize}
	\item 32
	\item 4294967264
	\item 32
	\item -32
	\item 0
	\item 0
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Exercise 2.4}
See ex24.cpp.

\subsubsection*{Exercise 2.5}
\begin{itemize}
	\item [(a)]
		In order: character literal; wide character literal; string literal; wide character string literal.
	\item [(b)]
		In order: integer; unsigned integer; long integer; unsigned long integer; octal integer; hexadecimal integer.
	\item [(c)]
		In order: double; float; long double.
	\item [(d)]
		In order: integer; unsigned integer; double; double.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Exercise 2.6}
In the first statement the definitions use integer literals so the values are what we expect, that is, \texttt{month = 9} and \texttt{day = 7}. In the second statement we try to define integers using octals however there is an error as 09 is not an octal and will throw an error.

\subsubsection*{Exercise 2.7}
\begin{itemize}
	\item [(a)]
		This is a string literal which represents ``Who goes with Fergus?''
	\item [(b)]
		The value is 3.1 and is a long double.
	\item [(c)]
		The value is 1024 and is a float.
	\item [(d)]
		The value is 3.14 and is a long double.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Exercise 2.8}
See ex28.cpp.

\subsubsection*{Exercise 2.9}
\begin{itemize}
	\item [(a)]
		Cannot use variable before it has been declared. To correct:\\
		\texttt{int input\_value;}\\
		\texttt{std::cin >> input\_value;}
	\item [(b)]
		Cannot use double in list initialisation since narrowing value may lose data. To correct:\\
		\texttt{double i = $\{$ 3.14 $\}$;}
	\item [(c)]
		Cannot use variable to initialise another variable before it has been initialised. To correct:\\
		\texttt{double wage = 9999.99;}\\
		\texttt{double salary = wage;}
	\item [(d)]
		This will initialise \texttt{i} to be an \texttt{int} but it will truncate it's value from 3.14 to 3.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Exercise 2.10}
\begin{itemize}
	\item \texttt{global\_str} will be an empty string.
	\item \texttt{global\_int} will be 0.
	\item \texttt{local\_int} will be undefined.
	\item \texttt{local\_str} will be an empty string.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Exercise 2.11}
\begin{itemize}
	\item [(a)]
		This is a definition since the variable is initialised and so memory is allocated for the variable.
	\item [(b)]
		This is a definition as the variable is defined locally and so memory is allocated for it.
	\item [(c)]
		This is a declaration of a variable as it specifies the variable is external without initialising its value.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Exercise 2.12}
\texttt{double} is a reserved C++ keyword and so is invalid, \texttt{catch-22} does not include valid characters in an identifier and so is invalid and lastly, \texttt{1\_or\_2} is invalid as it begins with a number.

\subsubsection*{Exercise 2.13}
Since \texttt{i} is defined globally and locally, within the block scope its value is that derived from initialisation within the block. So \texttt{j} will have value 100.

\subsubsection*{Exercise 2.14}
The program is legal since variables can be redefined in an inner scope (here this is the \texttt{for} loop). The program prints \texttt{100 45} since the value of \texttt{sum} is the sum of the numbers 0--9.
