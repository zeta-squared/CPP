What does the following for loop do? What is the final value of sum?
	int sum = 0;
	for (int i = -100; i <= 100; ++i)
		sum += i;

The for loop initialises i as an int type with value -100. It will then increment i by 1 until i reaches 100. At each iteration of the loop we add the value of i to sum. So the for loop sums the digits from -100 to 100 and so the final value is 0.
