Explain whether the following program fragment is legal.
	std:: cout << "The sum of " << v1;
			   << " and " << v2;
			   << " is " << v1 + v2 << std:endl;
If the program is legal, what does it do? If the program is not legal, why not? How would you fix it?

The program is not legal as the first line is a terminated statement (since ";" appears at the end of the line). So the second line is using the output operator (<<) but there is no valid left operand. To fix the fragment we need to remove ";" from the end of the first two lines as such,
	std:: cout << "The sum of " << v1
			   << " and " << v2
			   << " is " << v1 + v2 << std:endl;
